#By default Apache has no limit on the total size of the HTTP request
#when you allow large requests on a web server its possible that you could be a victim of Direct Denial of service attacks. 
#We can Limit the requests size of an Apache directive “LimitRequestBody” with the directory tag.
#You can set the value in bytes from 0 (unlimited) to 512000 (500KB) that are allowed in a request body.
#Use the below option to limit request for a directory in your web server
#replace /var/www/myweb1/user_uploads with your preferred directory path

#LimitRequestSize for a directory
<Directory "/var/www/myweb1/user_uploads">
   LimitRequestBody 512000
</Directory>

#Second option would be to limit request size generally

#LimitRequestSize 
LimitRequestBody 512000
